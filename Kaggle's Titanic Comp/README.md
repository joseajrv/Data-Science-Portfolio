# Kaggle Titanic Competition 

These are my python/scikit-learn codes for Kaggle titanic competition. 
I used different algorithms and at the moment the best performing one is the code with the exploratory analysis.
Requirements:
•	Python 3
•	Jupyter
•	Numpy==1.13.1
•	Pandas==0.20.3 
•	Matplotlib==2.0.2
•	Scikit-learn==0.19.0
•	Seaborn==0.8

Files:
•	Kaggle Titanic LM & LOG.ipynb: Contains all the feature engineering including options for generating different variable types, and performing PCA, clustering, and class balancing
•	Titanic Exploratory Cleaning and Prediction Data Analysis.ipynb: The code that executes the pipeline.
Other files contain data, results and algorithms that were used during experimentation and are in various stages of completeness.
