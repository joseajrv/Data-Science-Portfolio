# Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.

_Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory of each project) is for demonstration purposes only._

## Contents

- ### Machine Learning

	- [Predicting Boston Housing Prices](https://github.com/joseajrv/ML/blob/master/Boston%20Scikit%20Learn/Boston%20Housing%20.ipynb): A model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.

- ### Data Analysis and Visualisation
	- __Python__
		- [Kaggle Titanic Competition - Exploratory Analysis](https://github.com/joseajrv/ML/blob/master/Kaggle's%20Titanic%20Comp/Titanic%20Exploratory%20Cleaning%20and%20Prediction%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb): Exploratory Analysis of the passengers onboard RMS Titanic using Pandas and Seaborn visualisations and logistic regression to determine if a group of passengers survived or not using featured engineering on variables.
		
	_Tools: Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib, Scikit Learn

- ### Micro Projects: 

	- __Python__
		- [ML with Linear Regression](https://github.com/joseajrv/ML/blob/master/Ecommerce%20Project%20Exercise/Ecommerce%20Project%20Exercise.ipynb): Using Linear Regression to predict whether to focus efforts on the mobile app experience or the website of an Ecommerce.
		- [ML with Logistic Regression](https://github.com/joseajrv/ML/blob/master/Clicked%20on%20Ad%20Project/Logistic%20Regression%20Project%20.ipynb): Using Logistic Regression to predict whether an internet user clicked an ad or not.
		- [ML with K Nearest Neighbours](https://github.com/joseajrv/ML/blob/master/Unscaled%20data%20Project/KNN%20and%20scaling%20the%20data%20Project%201.ipynb): Using KNN to classify instances from a fake dataset into two target classes, while choosing the best value for K using the elbow method.
		- [ML with Decision Trees and Random Forests](https://github.com/): Using Decision Trees and Random Forests to predict whether a lender will pay their loan back. Uses publically available data from LendingClub.com
		- [Movie Recommendations using Recommender Systems](https://github.com): A micro project to build a recommendation system that makes movie recommendations based on user review similarities. 

- ### Results of Statistical Analysis (Given that all these statistical studies and reports where made in Buenos Aires, Argentina, they are written in Spanish, in future updates Iâ€™ll try to translate them). The data of these studies come from surveys, which is property of Adriana Falcon, MBA Professor of the Graduate Business School of the University of Palermo, I am only free to publicly disclose the results of the given analysis.
	- [Alfajores Analysis]( https://github.com/joseajrv/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Quantitative%20Methods/Mini%20Alfajores.md): A discriminant function analysis to understand the key characteristics that determine the preference of the customers of a disclosed brand of Alfajores ins Buenos Aires.
	- [Guns and Security Alarms Analysis]( https://github.com/joseajrv/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Quantitative%20Methods/armas%20y%20alarmas.md): A discriminant function analysis to understand the preferences of each individual between guns or security alarms given a determined set of variables result of a survey.
	- [ALL STAR Survey Analysis]( https://github.com/joseajrv/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Quantitative%20Methods/All%20star.md): A factor analysis to understand the variables that motivate the young clients to buy ALL STAR shoes in Buenos Aires.
	- [Sports MKT ]( https://github.com/joseajrv/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Quantitative%20Methods/MKT%20del%20deporte.md): Result of an analysis of variance (ANOVA), factor analysis and cluster analysis of a 618 users survey from a sports complex, looking to understand their motivations in order to segment them and determine the right marketing strategy for each segment.
	- [Five Star Pet Hotels Survey Analysis]( https://github.com/joseajrv/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Quantitative%20Methods/hoteles%20cinco%20estrellas.md): Cluster analysis to further understand the key characteristics of certain groups of dog owners that they look for when they travel without their pets.
