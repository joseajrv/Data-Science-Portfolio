# Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self-learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.


_Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory of each project) is for demonstration purposes only._

## Contents

- ### Machine Learning

	- [Analytics Vidhya Black Friday Competition](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/joseajrv/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Black%20Friday/Black%20Friday.ipynb): A model to predict the customer purchase behaviour (purchase amount) against various products of different categories using ML algorithms, with Random Forest Regression and grid search in order to improve the precision of the prediction.

	- [Predicting Boston Housing Prices](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/joseajrv/ML/blob/master/Boston%20Scikit%20Learn/Boston%20Housing%20.ipynb): A model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.

	- [Kaggle Titanic Decision Tree and Random Forest with Grid Search](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/joseajrv/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Kaggle's%20Titanic%20Comp/Kaggle%20Titanic%20Comparing%20Decision%20Tree%20and%20Random%20Forest%20with%20Grid%20Search.ipynb): A model to predict whether the passengers survived or not the Titanic using ML algorithms, first Random Forest Regression to predict the missing data from the Ages column, after that it compares the results between logistic regression, decision trees and random forest classifier with grid search in order to improve the precision of the prediction.

- ### Exploratory analysis
	- [Titanic - Exploratory Analysis](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/joseajrv/ML/blob/master/Kaggle's%20Titanic%20Comp/Titanic%20Exploratory%20Cleaning%20and%20Prediction%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb): Exploratory Analysis of the passengers onboard RMS Titanic using Pandas and Seaborn visualizations and logistic regression to determine if a group of passengers survived or not using featured engineering on variables.


	_Tools: Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib, Scikit Learn

- ### Micro Projects:

		- [Movie Recommendations using Recommender Systems](https://github.com): A micro project to build a recommendation system that makes movie recommendations based on user review similarities.

- ### Short Reports of Statistical Analysis
	- [Quantitative Methods]( https://github.com/joseajrv/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/Quantitative%20Methods): Short text reports from surveys and statistical studies made in Buenos Aires.

_Note: on "Short Reports of Statistical Analysis": Given that all these statistical studies and reports where made in Buenos Aires, Argentina, they are written in Spanish, in future updates I’ll try to translate them). The data of these studies come from surveys, which is property of Adriana Falcon, MBA Professor of the Graduate Business School of the University of Palermo, I am only free to publicly disclose the results of the given analysis.
