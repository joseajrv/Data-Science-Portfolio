# Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self-learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.

_Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory of each project) is for demonstration purposes only._

## Contents

- ### Machine Learning

	- [Predicting Boston Housing Prices](https://github.com/joseajrv/ML/blob/master/Boston%20Scikit%20Learn/Boston%20Housing%20.ipynb): A model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.

- ### Data Analysis and Visualization
	- __Python__
		- [Kaggle Titanic Competition - Exploratory Analysis](https://github.com/joseajrv/ML/blob/master/Kaggle's%20Titanic%20Comp/Titanic%20Exploratory%20Cleaning%20and%20Prediction%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb): Exploratory Analysis of the passengers onboard RMS Titanic using Pandas and Seaborn visualizations and logistic regression to determine if a group of passengers survived or not using featured engineering on variables.

	_Tools: Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib, Scikit Learn

- ### Micro Projects:

	- __Python__
		- [ML with Linear Regression](https://github.com/joseajrv/ML/blob/master/Ecommerce%20Project%20Exercise/Ecommerce%20Project%20Exercise.ipynb): Using Linear Regression to predict whether to focus efforts on the mobile app experience or the website of an Ecommerce.
		- [ML with Logistic Regression](https://github.com/joseajrv/ML/blob/master/Clicked%20on%20Ad%20Project/Logistic%20Regression%20Project%20.ipynb): Using Logistic Regression to predict whether an internet user clicked an ad or not.
		- [ML with K Nearest Neighbours](https://github.com/joseajrv/ML/blob/master/Unscaled%20data%20Project/KNN%20and%20scaling%20the%20data%20Project%201.ipynb): Using KNN to classify instances from a fake dataset into two target classes, while choosing the best value for K using the elbow method.
		- [ML with Decision Trees and Random Forests]( https://github.com/joseajrv/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Lending%20Club%20Project/Decision%20Trees%20and%20Random%20Forest%20Project%20.ipynb): Using Decision Trees and Random Forests to predict whether a lender will pay their loan back. Uses publicly available data from LendingClub.com
		- [ML with SVM and Grid Search](https://github.com/joseajrv/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Scikit-Learn%20Breast%20Cancer%20Data/SVM%20and%20Grid%20Search.ipynb): Using SVM and Grid Search to predict whether a tumour is malingnant or bening. Uses [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic) from Scikit Learn.
		- [ML with K Means Clustering](https://github.com/joseajrv/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Iris%20Dataset%20Project/Iris%20Dataset%20K%20Means%20Clustering%20Project.ipynb):Simple K Means Clustering algorithm to predict the species of the iris flowers dataset.
		- [Movie Recommendations using Recommender Systems](https://github.com): A micro project to build a recommendation system that makes movie recommendations based on user review similarities.

- ### Short Reports of Statistical Analysis
	- [Quantitative Methods]( https://github.com/joseajrv/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/Quantitative%20Methods): Short text reports from surveys and statistical studies made in Buenos Aires.

_Note on "Short Reports of Statistical Analysis": Given that all these statistical studies and reports where made in Buenos Aires, Argentina, they are written in Spanish, in future updates I’ll try to translate them). The data of these studies come from surveys, which is property of Adriana Falcon, MBA Professor of the Graduate Business School of the University of Palermo, I am only free to publicly disclose the results of the given analysis.
